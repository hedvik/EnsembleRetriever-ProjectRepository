This is the project repository for Ensemble Retriever, a project for a masters thesis on redirected walking using distractors. Ensemble Retriever is an Action VR RPG that integrates redirected walking into the experience through the use of distractors. The player plays as a conductor that has to explore a large virtual space in search for ''The Mountain King'', which is an instrument that has escaped their ensemble. Throughout their adventure they will have to fight various random enemy encounters and find clues for how they can enter ''The Hall of The Mountain King''. The game culminates into a battle against ''The Mountain King'' which challenges the player's skills which they have built thoughout the playtime of the game. 

## Cloning
* When cloning the repository, there will be a few .CSV files which cannot be cloned due to Git LFS having been disabled. These files would originally be found in Assets/ExperimentData/.
* Instead, these files can be gotten from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlZIw-ShrxkVyE99qqmG_3XjcrrI?e=ymWrAn)

## Documentation
* Additional documentation on the software itself can be found in the masters thesis for this project. The link to this thesis will be added whenever it has been published.
